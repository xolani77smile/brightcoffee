Case Study for COFFEE to increase coffee sales

Explain the project
This case study examines three coffee shops across different locations, each with unique customer demographics and purchasing behaviors. By analyzing transactional data, we uncover sales trends, peak hours, and product performance, providing insights to optimize operations and strengthen brand positioning.​

Objectives 
Tools Used:
SQL Queries – Extracted transactional data, categorized time buckets, and identified peak hours.  Data Visualization (Excel) – Created bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for sales trends. Structured Presentation – Organized findings into clear slides with concise narratives.

What You Learned:
Peak sales hours matter – Morning rush (6–12 PM) drives the highest transactions. Product preferences differ by location – Tea dominates Astoria, Chai thrives in Hell’s Kitchen, Croissants lead in Lower Manhattan. Optimized inventory & staffing improve efficiency – Aligning stock levels and workforce with demand boosts performance. Targeted marketing enhances sales – Promotions tailored to top-selling items and customer trends drive engagement.
I really enjoyed the process.
